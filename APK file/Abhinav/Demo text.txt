Hi, This is Barclays cognitive agent demo. This cognitive agent utilizes machine learning to resolve customer issues. It can make various system calls with the help of robotic SMEs.




Customer Calls Cognitive agent. It says Hello to the agent.

Cognitive agent process the message with the help of natural language processing abilities and responds to the customer.






Customer raises issue with the cognitive agent. Here customer has lost his Amex and raising the same as an issue with bank.


Cognitive agent processes this message using Watson Natural language classifier and Watson Rank and retrive. 
Natural language classifier helps understand the issues as related to Cards system.
while Rank and retrive can assist to find out the process to resolve card issues. As next step rank and retirve asked for customer id to invoke Cards robot.



Based on customer id. Cognitive agent has invoked cards robot who has fetched customer cards details.
